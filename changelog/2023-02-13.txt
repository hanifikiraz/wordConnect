1. Changed the rewarded ad video button's icon. Added the word "AD" on the icon' PNG as per google admob requirements. 
You should edit sprite sheet number 2. It is under the resources folder. You should repack your atlas texture using the free texture packer software.
The information about how to use the texture packer is in the help file.
2. Editted WatchAndEarnDialog.java file to display the number of coins earned. Google admob enforces this.
3. Editted strings.properties files for both en and tr languages. Added a parameter for ad_invite key. These are under android/assets/data folder.
4. Perform the above modifications for your own languages too otherwise ad serve may be stopped by admob.
5. Updated some libraries in the root build.gradle file.
