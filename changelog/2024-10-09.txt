Make a backup of your project and keep it.

1. In AndroidLauncher.java file, added the following line into the onCreate method to avoid random crashes.
getWindow().getDecorView();

2. In the root build.gradle file, updated google services to 4.4.2.
3. In the root build.gradle file, updated play-services-ads to 23.4.0.
4. In the root build.gradle file, updated user-messaging-platform to 3.0.0.
5. In the root build.gradle file, updated billing to 7.1.1.
6. The feature of sending coins to certain users is removed from the project because it is rarely used and hard to maintain.
If you want to keep it,
	In the root build.gradle file, update firebase-bom to 33.4.0.
	In the root build.gradle file, add the following line below the previewly mentioned entry:
	implementation 'androidx.localbroadcastmanager:localbroadcastmanager:1.1.0'
	
If you decide to remove this feature too, then comment out the lines as in root build.gradle and AndroidLauncher.java files. Delete WordConnectFirebaseMessagingService.java.
You should also comment out the service node in the Androidmanifest.xml file.
The best is not to touch anything.

7. After all these, I tried to build a release APK but failed with the message "missing classes detected while running r8...". In the build log of 
Android Studio, I saw that two classes must be added into proguard-rules.pro file. So added the following lines into that file and it happily built the APK:

-dontwarn android.media.LoudnessCodecController$OnLoudnessCodecUpdateListener
-dontwarn android.media.LoudnessCodecController
