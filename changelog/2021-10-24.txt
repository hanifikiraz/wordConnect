Make sure that your Android Studio is up-to-date. Also backup your project just in case something goes wrong.

1. Fixed the issue of diminishing coins when the board is full of coins and letters. This happens if you try to apply a reveal hint.

Fix: Open GameScreen.java and replace the "closeBoardOverlayAndAnimateHint" and "revealLetter" methods completely with the new version found in the updated GameScreen.java source code.


2. Fix: Level Generator Database.findRandomWordTobeLetters (add "+ "AND score > 0 " in query )

3. Upgraded Gradle Version to 7.3. File->Project Structure, Project->Gradle Version, select 7.3.

4. Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin Version to 7.0.3. File->Project Structure, Project->Android Gradle Plugin Version, select 7.0.3.

5. Updated google services classpath to 4.3.10. Open the top-level build.gradle file, find 'com.google.gms:google-services' and set its version to 4.3.10. Sync the project.

6. Upgraded GDPR library to 2.0.0. Open the top-level build.gradle file, find 'com.google.android.ump:user-messaging-platform' and set its version to 2.0.0. Sync the project.

7. Upgraded Admob to 20.5.0. Open the top-level build.gradle file, find 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads' and set its version to 20.5.0. Sync the project.
Replace the contents of AdActivity with the new one, many things have changed due to upgrade. Then try to run the app. You will get an error concerning something incompatible.
The next step will fix this.

8. Updated SDK version to 31. Open the android-level build.gradle file. Set compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion to 31 and buildToolsVersion to 31.0.0. Sync the project.
If the sync fails saying "Manifest merger failed due to android:exported", open AndroidManifest.xml, find the "activity" tag, it should be underlined with a red line,
hover your mouse over the word "activity", it will suggest you to add "exported=true", choose it to have it set automatically. Now try to run the game again, this
time you may get this error: Cannot fit requested classes in a single dex file. Onwards to the next step.

9. Add multidex support because the upgraded libraries will not fit in a single dex file. Open the top-level build.gradle file. Find the line that contains 
'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging'. Add the line below that: 

implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'

Then in the android-level build.gradle file, find "versionName" and add the following line below that:

multiDexEnabled true

Sync the project. Now you should be able to install the app and test the new version of admob library. Don't forget to activate the testing admob mode in strings.xml.

10. Upgrade IAP to 4.0.0. Open the top-level build.gradle file, find 'com.android.billingclient:billing' and set its version to 4.0.0. Sync the project.
Replace the contents of IAPActivity with the new one, many things have changed due to upgrade.

11. Made changes in android/assets/data/en/strings.properties and android/assets/data/tr/strings.properties because google has warned some users about misleading text for rewarded ads.
changed the value of free_hints, ad_invite
